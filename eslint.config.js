// REACT-HOOKS v6 (Expo SDK 57).
//
// The SDK 54 -> 57 upgrade pulled eslint-plugin-react-hooks v6, which turns on
// three rules that did not exist before and made 84 pre-existing lines fail
// CI. They are not one problem, so they are not handled one way:
//
//   react-hooks/refs (52 of the 84)
//     Almost all of it was `useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current`, the old RN
//     idiom, which really does read a ref during render. Fixed properly rather
//     than silenced — see app/lib/useAnimatedValue.ts. Five deliberate
//     ref-reads survive and carry their own inline disable + reason.
//
//   react-hooks/immutability (16)
//     Every single one is `sharedValue.value = x` in a Reanimated worklet or
//     gesture callback. That is not a mutation the rule thinks it is: a
//     SharedValue is Reanimated's own state container, assigning to `.value`
//     IS its public API, and there is no alternative formulation. The rule
//     cannot tell a SharedValue from a plain object, so it is off for the four
//     files that drive animations — and only those four, so that a genuine
//     mutation-during-render anywhere else still fails the build.
//
//   react-hooks/set-state-in-effect (16)
//     A real anti-pattern, and unlike the other two these are worth actually
//     fixing: they are mostly "copy props into local state when a modal
//     opens", which should be a `key` remount or a render-time comparison
//     instead. Every one is behaviour-sensitive (form state, theme
//     hydration, the create-event wizard), so rewriting them blind inside an
//     unrelated PR is how you ship a subtle regression. Downgraded to a
//     warning so it stays visible in every lint run, with its own ticket.
//     New code should not add to the pile: the warning is the reminder.
