// Generic two-button modal used by the RSVP flow:
//   - "Open external link?"
//   - "Did you RSVP?"
//   - "Cancel RSVP?"
//
// Layout follows the Figma:
//   - Large bold title
//   - Optional body paragraph (regular weight)
//   - Optional emphasised line (bold), after the body by default or before it
//     with `emphasisFirst` — see the prop
//   - Secondary button on top (outlined / safe option)
//   - Primary button on bottom (filled; red when destructive)
