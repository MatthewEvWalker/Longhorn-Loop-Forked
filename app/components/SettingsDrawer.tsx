// The settings panel that pulls in from the right edge, TikTok-style.
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. The profile's hamburger opened a 220pt dropdown with two
// links, each of which pushed a full screen. Three taps and two screen
// transitions to reach a toggle, and the only way in was hitting a 28pt target
// in the corner. Nothing about it responded to the gesture people now expect
// from a right-hand menu.
//
// This wraps the profile's content rather than sitting over it, for the same
// reason the create wizard's back-swipe does: an overlay big enough to catch
// an edge gesture is also big enough to swallow every tap underneath it. As a
// wrapper the gesture sees the touch first and passes it on when it isn't a
// drag.
//
// The panel holds the real settings hub, not a copy of it. SettingsEntryScreen
// takes an onBack prop so the same component serves the /settings route and
// this drawer, and the org list inside it stays one implementation.
