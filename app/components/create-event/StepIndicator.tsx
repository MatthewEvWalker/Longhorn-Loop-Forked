// The create wizard's step indicator: six segments, each labelled, with the
// completed ones tappable.
//
// This replaces a bare StepPills in all six screens. StepPills said how far
// along you were and nothing else -- six identical bars, no names, no way to
// get back to one except pressing the header arrow repeatedly. Onboarding
// still uses it, and should: that flow is linear and its steps have no names
// worth showing.
//
// Three states, and each is doing a job:
//   completed  filled bar + a tick above it, tappable
//   current    filled bar + a brand-coloured label
//   upcoming   track bar + a muted label
//
// The tick is what separates "done" from "here" -- both bars are filled, so
// without it the current step is only distinguishable by label colour, which
// is a thin signal at 10pt.
//
// No "Edit steps" button and no "tap a step to edit" hint. Six named,
// touchable columns already read as navigation; a caption explaining that
// would be admitting they don't.
