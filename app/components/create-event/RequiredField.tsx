// boolean and disabled the button when it was false. That is silent in the
// worst way: the button greys out, the user presses it, nothing happens, and
// nothing on screen says which field is missing. On the Event Details step
// there are three required fields and a disabled button tells you about none
// of them.
//
// So required fields are marked BEFORE you fill them in -- the asterisk -- and
// named AFTER you try to continue without one -- the message. The button stays
// pressable throughout, because a press is how someone asks "what's left?" and
// a disabled button refuses to answer.
