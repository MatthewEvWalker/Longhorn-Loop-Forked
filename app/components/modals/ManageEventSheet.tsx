// The Manage Event sheet, opened by the pencil on a card in the profile's
// Posted tab.
//
// A bottom sheet rather than a menu or a new screen, because the four actions
// are about one specific event and the sheet carries a summary of that event at
// the top. Half of them are destructive-ish; a full-screen push would lose the
// context of which card you tapped, and a tiny popover would leave no room to
// say which event you are about to cancel.
//
// Delete is last and red. It is the only irreversible one, and putting it
// anywhere but the end of the list puts it under a thumb reaching for
// something else.

/**
 * THE ICON COLUMN, and why it is not just "centre them all".
 *
 * The Figma gives each row its own icon size and its own gap -- eye 24 at gap
 * 14, pencil 20 at 16, megaphone 19 at 16, trash 20 at 16 -- which puts the
 * four labels at x = 38, 36, 35 and 36. The design is itself misaligned,
 * because the icons came from three different sets and nobody normalised them.
 *
 * A fixed column fixes the LABELS. It does not fix the icons, and that was the
 * remaining visible problem: centring a 24pt eye and a 19pt megaphone in the
 * same column aligns their bounding boxes, and their bounding boxes are not
 * what you see. Each glyph is drawn with a different amount of empty space
 * inside its own box -- the Figma spells this out, eye ink starts at 9.94% of
 * its width, trash at 16.67% -- so centred boxes put the visible ink at four
 * different x positions, about 3pt apart. Which is exactly what "not lined up
 * properly" looks like.
 *
 * So the boxes are LEFT-aligned in the column, and each icon is nudged by the
 * difference between its own ink inset and a common one. The four glyphs then
 * start at the same x, which is the thing the eye is actually measuring.

        babel.config runs babel-preset-expo with jsxImportSource: 'nativewind',
        so every JSX element in the app goes through NativeWind's jsx runtime --
        className or not. A `style` prop given as a FUNCTION does not survive
        that: whatever the callback returns is dropped, silently.

        Here that took the whole row style with it, not just the pressed colour,
        because the callback was returning [styles.actionRow, ...]. Losing
        actionRow means losing flexDirection: 'row', so the label rendered
        UNDERNEATH the icon instead of beside it, and the pressed highlight
        never appeared either. One dropped prop, two symptoms, and neither of
        them looks like "your style prop was ignored".

        Pressed is ordinary state and the style is a plain object.
