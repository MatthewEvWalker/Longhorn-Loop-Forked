/**
 * THE ICON COLUMN, and why it is not just "centre them all".
 *
 * The Figma gives each row its own icon size and its own gap -- eye 24 at gap
 * 14, pencil 20 at 16, megaphone 19 at 16, trash 20 at 16 -- which puts the
 * four labels at x = 38, 36, 35 and 36. The design is itself misaligned,
 * because the icons came from three different sets and nobody normalised them.
 *
 * A fixed column fixes the LABELS. It does not fix the icons, and that was the
 * remaining visible problem: centring a 24pt eye and a 19pt megaphone in the
 * same column aligns their bounding boxes, and their bounding boxes are not
 * what you see. Each glyph is drawn with a different amount of empty space
 * inside its own box -- the Figma spells this out, eye ink starts at 9.94% of
 * its width, trash at 16.67% -- so centred boxes put the visible ink at four
 * different x positions, about 3pt apart. Which is exactly what "not lined up
 * properly" looks like.
 *
 * So the boxes are LEFT-aligned in the column, and each icon is nudged by the
 * difference between its own ink inset and a common one. The four glyphs then
 * start at the same x, which is the thing the eye is actually measuring.
