// The Profile tab's icon: your own avatar, not a generic silhouette.
//
// Every other tab is an abstraction -- a house, a compass, a plus -- and a
// silhouette was the odd one out, because the thing behind it is not "a
// profile", it is YOURS. A tab bar showing your face is also how you tell at a
// glance which account the app is in, which matters more now that logging out
// and back in is a flow people actually use.
//
// SHARES THE PROFILE SCREEN'S QUERY, deliberately. Same key, so there is one
// fetch between the two and the tab updates the moment you change your picture
// on the screen it links to -- react-query hands both the same cache entry, so
// no invalidation or prop-drilling is involved.
//
// Falls back to the drawn icon whenever there is nothing to show: still
// loading, signed out, or an account with no avatar chosen. The fallback is
// the SAME asset the other tabs use, so a fresh account still gets a coherent
// bar rather than a gap.
//
// THE WORD "Profile" IS PART OF THE ARTWORK, not a tab bar label. Every tab
// SVG is a 42-wide artboard holding both the glyph (y 0..18) and its word
// (y ~26..35) -- which is why `tabBarShowLabel` is false and the tint prop
// colours both at once. Swapping the whole 42x38 asset for an avatar
// therefore took the word with it, and Profile was the only unlabelled tab.
// tab-profile-label.svg is that same word on the same artboard with the head
// glyph removed, so laying it under the avatar puts the text back on the
// exact baseline the other three sit on -- no font guessing, no drift if the
// artwork is ever redrawn.
