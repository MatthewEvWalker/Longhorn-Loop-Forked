/**
 * shared/externalUrl.ts — the guard in front of every hand-off to the platform
 * browser (LOOP-278).
 *
 * Two testers lost the app to a tap on an externally ticketed event's RSVP:
 * frozen on iPhone, hard crash on iPad. Half of that was a presentation race
 * (see app/lib/externalLink.ts); the other half was that nothing checked the
 * stored link first. `rsvp_url` is validated on POST /events/create but NOT in
 * events/ingest.ts, so a scraped row can hold anything a link regex grabbed.
 *
 * The cases below are the shapes that actually reach this function, and the
 * two named ones are the reported crashes. There is no client test runner, so
 * this suite is the only executable check on the coercion — which is why the
 * function lives in shared/ rather than in app/lib.
