// Turns a pending org invite into actual membership.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. POST /orgs/:id/invites writes an org_invites row with
// status 'pending' and emails the person. Nothing ever read that row back.
// There was code to CREATE an invite and code to REVOKE one, and no code
// anywhere that accepted one -- so an invited student signed in, found no
// organisation, and the admin saw an invite sitting at 'pending' forever with
// no way to tell whether it had been received.
//
// WHY EMAIL IS THE JOIN. An invite is addressed before the person exists in
// our database: an admin types an email, and that address may belong to
// somebody who has never opened the app. So the invite cannot hold a user id,
// and membership can only be granted once an account with that address turns
// up. Email is the only thing the two sides share.
//
// That makes the email comparison load-bearing, which is why it is normalised
// on both sides rather than compared as typed. An admin inviting
// "Student@my.utexas.edu" and a student signing in as
// "student@my.utexas.edu" are the same person, and a case-sensitive compare
// silently isn't.
