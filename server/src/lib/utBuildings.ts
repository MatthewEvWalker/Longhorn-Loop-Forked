// THE PROBLEM. Ten of the twelve scrapers set `latitude: null` outright --
// only HornsLink and Pharmacy get coordinates from their feed. Everything
// else arrives with a location string and nothing else, so the Explore map
// had almost nothing to pin. And those strings are written for students:
// "GSB 2.126", "utc 2.102", "Welch 2.224". Nobody publishes a latitude next
// to a room number.
//
// data/ut-buildings.json is the single source of truth -- 204 buildings from
// UT's own Building Information pages, with coordinates taken from the marker
// on each building's official page. Coordinates appear nowhere else in this
// repo; when UT moves a building, that file is the only edit.
