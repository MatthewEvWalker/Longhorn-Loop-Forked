/**
 * Reading the `exp` claim off our own JWTs, without a library.
 *
 * Lives in shared/ for the usual reason (see shared/taxonomy.ts,
 * shared/orgRegistration.ts): both sides need the same answer and must not
 * drift. The client uses it at launch to decide whether a stored token is
 * worth restoring; keeping the rule here means it can never disagree with the
 * server's own expiry check in lib/utils.ts getAuthUser.
 *
 * Dependency-free by design — no React, no Worker globals, no jose/jsonwebtoken.
 * `atob` is present in Workers, in Node 16+, and in Hermes on RN 0.74+, with a
 * Buffer fallback for anything older.
 *
 * THIS DOES NOT VERIFY THE SIGNATURE, and must never be used to decide whether
 * a request is authorized. It answers exactly one question — "is this token
 * already past its expiry" — so the app can send someone to sign in instead of
 * letting them in and having every screen 401 at once. The Worker still
 * verifies the HMAC on every request; that is the real gate.
